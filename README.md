# üíº Bank Direct Marketing DSS (Decision Support System)

A professional and interactive web-based Decision Support System (DSS) for targeted bank marketing campaigns, leveraging advanced machine learning ensemble models and interpretable AI (SHAP).  
This app helps marketing teams to upload customer data, select or ensemble multiple predictive models, and identify the most promising clients for a direct marketing campaign, along with actionable feature-level explanations.

## üìù Project Overview

This project implements a full pipeline for **imbalanced customer classification** in bank direct marketing, including:
- Advanced data preprocessing, outlier removal, and feature engineering
- Application of oversampling methods (SMOTE, ADASYN) to address class imbalance
- Training and hyperparameter optimization of multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, MLP)
- Ensemble learning (Voting) for robust prediction
- Interpretability using SHAP for model explanations
- Professional, user-friendly dashboard (Streamlit) for campaign decision support
